## Hi 👋 Shayan here
I am an undergraduate student with a passion for learning and building things as well as
solving challenging problems. I have a proven track record of self-learning new things
everyday and using them to build meaningful things for all. I am currently working on
building an Open-Sourced Physics simulator called Isaac that uses OpenGL. I wholeheartedly
invite people to collaborate with me on  Development of Isaac.
